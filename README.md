## 📖 About  

This is my personal developer portfolio.  
I built it to highlight the work I’ve done, the technologies I specialize in, and the projects I’m most proud of.  

It’s designed to be clean, minimal, and professional while still reflecting my personal style.  

Feel free to explore, and if you’re a recruiter, client, or fellow dev—welcome to my corner of the internet.
